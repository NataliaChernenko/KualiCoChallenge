Programming challenge for KualiCo

This is an updated version of this elevator simulation. I have added a motion simulator that simulates an elevator moving between floors at a given rate. Each elevator can have its own speed, but the default is 5 seconds between floors. In this model the passenger requests an elevator to his/her current floor. Once inside the elevator, the passenger selects his/her destination. This is when the elevator is considered occupied. If no destination is made, then the elevator is considered empty.

One current flaw is that if an elevator is moving and stops to pick up another passenger, the original passenger will need to reenter the original destination. This is a future addition that would improve this simulation. 

A second addition that I would like to make in the future is adding the ability of a passenger press "up" or "down" buttons to request an elevator. This would make the elevator stopping on the way to another floor be more efficient.
