Programming challenge for KualiCo

This is an updated version of this elevator simulation. I have added a motion simulator that simulates an elevator moving between floors at a given rate. Each elevator can have its own speed, but the default is 5 seconds between floors. In this model the passenger requests an elevator to his/her current floor. Once inside the elevator, the passenger selects his/her destination. This is when the elevator is considered occupied. If no destination is made, then the elevator is considered empty. I also added the ability for a passenger to press an "up" or "down" button when requesing an elevator. This makes the algorithm for the elvator stopping on the way to another floor be more efficient.
